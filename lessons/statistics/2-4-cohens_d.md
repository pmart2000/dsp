[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> The Cohen effect size for difference in the respondents with the highest income 
and the rest of the respondents is -0.125; that is, respondents in the highest
income category had less children than those in the other categories by 0.125 standard
deviations. The absolute value of this difference is 4 to 5 times greater than Cohen's
*d* for pregnancy length between first babies and others (0.029), but it is still fairly
small.
